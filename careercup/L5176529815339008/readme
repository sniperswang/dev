/* 
Amazon employees are encouraged to learn and be curious, and this means employees can transfer teams within the company easily. 
This usually means they'll move to a new building, and for those who have parking, they'd need to swap parking spots. 
The task is that given a list of employees who want to swap parking spots, write a function that can match them up 1 to 1. 
The output can simply be tuples of aliases. 
Each alias should only be matched once. 


Input- 
alias fromBuilding toBuilding 
adrian building1 building2 
john building2 building1 
andrew building3 building2 
william building4 building3 
John building2 building4 
Doe 

output- 
adrian,john
